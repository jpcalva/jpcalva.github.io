# About Me
## My Hobbies
	* Playing piano - Playing piano is a favorite pastime that I practice almost daily.
	* Writing music - Along with piano, I love writing my own music with all kinds of acoustic instruments.
	* Reading webcomics - I am pretty obsessed with webcomics such as mangas and manhwas, especially from the website _Webtoon_
## My favorite songs at the moment
	* [Slowdive - When The Sun Hits](https://youtu.be/MKYY0IlTMw4?si=U9primbvQ2b91BlR) - This song reminds me so much of Autumn, can't wait for the season
	* [Strange Boutique - Dream](https://youtu.be/LGrca9EK_qQ?si=WjglZZAXpLxeYnTU) - Such a dreamy and spooky song, reminds me of Halloween coming up.
